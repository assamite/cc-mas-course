This documentation holds tips and sample code relevant to 
`the course <https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/courses/582759/2016/s/k/1>`_. All the
code is written with **Python 3.5** in mind. Although many of the snippets work on
earlier Python versions, we recommend installing Python 3.5 straight away (see
:doc:`setup`).
