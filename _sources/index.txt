This documentation holds tips and sample code relevant to 
`the course <https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/courses/582759/2016/s/k/1>`_. All the
code is written Python 3.5 in mind. Although many of the snippets work on earlier
Python versions, we recommend to install Python 3.5 straight away.

The repository for the full example codes and additional material is in 
`github <https://github.com/assamite/cc-mas16>`_.
