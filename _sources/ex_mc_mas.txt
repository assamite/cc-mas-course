Week 2 - Markov Chains, Multi-agent Systems
===========================================

.. centered::
		(Wed 9.11. 10.41) The second week's exercises are now ready (although
		we might add some clarifications).

|

	#. **RETURN** Alter your function ``markov_chain`` from the first week to
	   accept an optional parameter ``order`` which specifies the order of the
	   Markov chain to be created. That is, with ``order=2`` a state contains
	   two successive tokens from the same sentence.
	
	#. **RETURN** Alter your function ``generate`` from the first week to be compatible with your
	   new ``markov_chain`` implementation (from the exercise 1. in this week).
	   The returned piece of text should be a single string with no repeating
	   words, or nested arrays, etc. Experiment by generating text with different
	   order Markov chains. What observations do you make? List your findings
	   shortly (either as a comment in the module, or somewhere else).

	#. Familiarize yourself with :doc:`toy_mas`. See that you understand how
	   a single agent functions, how the voting procedure is called and how the
	   simulation is run.

	#. **RETURN** Create a function ``random_words`` which accepts the same parameters as
	   the ``frequent_words`` in the example (see :doc:`toy_mas`), but returns a list of random words
	   from the file (with length *n*). Create a new simulation where half of
	   the agents in the environment use ``frequent_words`` and other half
	   ``random_words`` to learn their vocabulary (you can alter the number
	   of agents if you wish in your experiments). Run the simulation repeatedly.
	   What do you observe, if anything? 

	   Additional notes:

	   	* To make real observations, you need to add some logging or other ways
	   	  to see how each group values artifacts made by the agents in the same
	   	  group and the agents in the other group. Some aggregate measures when
	   	  observing agents' voting behavior might be a good start. This is most
	   	  easily done in the environment (:class:`ToyEnvironment`) where we defined
	   	  the callback method :func:`vote`. Although the method :func:`perform_voting`
	   	  only returns the winner of the vote, you can manually get each agent's
	   	  vote by triggering agent's :func:`vote`. Observe (the code block
	   	  should be inside the environment's :func:`vote`, before the
	   	  candidates are cleared)::

			cands = self.candidates
			votes = {}
			for agent in self.get_agents(address=False):
				votes[agent.name] = agent.vote(cands)

		  Now you can count whatever you like from the ``votes`` for each of the agents.
		  (This adds some complexity as the voting is done twice, but we do
		  not care for it right now.)

	#. Change your agent to generate text based on Markov chain instead. That is, alter the
	   ``generate`` function to use Markov chain (either first-order or higher). It is up to you, if you
	   learn the state transition probabilities at initialization time for each
	   agent (not advised because of redundancy), or do you first learn the
	   state transition probabilities from a single source and then give them
	   to each agent at initialization time as a parameter. The pieces of text
	   generated can be of fixed (token) length.

	   Additional notes:

	   	* When returning the exercise, add the file from where the Markov chain
	   	  was learned in the compressed file (if it is not too big, say >20mb).

		* If you want to learn a Markov chain from a larger corpus than
		  last week, there is a `simple script in the repository
		  <https://github.com/assamite/cc-mas-course/blob/master/week2/parse_BNC.py>`_
		  which parses British National Corpus for fiction texts and writes a list of
		  (text, part-of-speech)-tuples into a file. However, using that script
		  is completely optional. You may also see that the script is not very
		  well implemented, and it is your job to make it more efficient.

	#. Create an evaluation function for the generated pieces of text based on the last
	   week's pseudolikelihood function. (If you have not implemented it, ask
	   from someone who has.) That is, the evaluation for the Markov chain
	   is the (pseudo)likelihood of the generated text w.r.t. the state
	   transition probabilities. Is this kind of evaluation
	   function desirable?

	#. **RETURN** Create a simulation where part of the agents learn the Markov
	   chain from a source **A**, and another part from a source **B**. The agents
	   evaluate the generated texts with their own (pseudo)likelihood functions. Run the
	   simulation repeatedly and make observations as in the exercise 4.

	   Additional notes:

	   	* The sources can be anything you like, however, they should be sufficiently long (at least
	   	  the same size as the last week's Alice).

	#. **RETURN** Create a new evaluation function for the generated pieces of text.
	   Design it any way you like, but aim to "as intelligent as you can get"
	   and justify your decisions in the function's docstring.

	#. Create a simulation where part of the agents learn the Markov
	   chain from a source **A**, and another part from a source **B** and they
	   evaluate the generated text with **the evaluation function you designed** in
	   the previous exercise. Run the simulation repeatedly and make observations
	   as in the exercise 4.
