Getting Started
===============

This page goes through basic setup of the development environment for Python.
We strongly encourage the use of virtual environments (see below).

.. note::
	These instructions are made for Unix (and OSX). Some of the steps will
	not work on Windows. Should you encounter any problems, please try to solve
	them first by yourself as the course staff's Windows experiences tend to be
	old.

Installing Python 3.5.x
-----------------------

First, start by installing `Python 3.5 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/>`_.
For OSX and Windows, the site offers installers. For Linux, follow the standard
procedure as described in the README::

	~$ ./configure
	~$ make
	~$ make test
	~$ sudo make install

In case you want to install Python without root (to be used, e.g. in Ukko),
use ``./configure prefix=path/to/install/folder``.


Creating a Virtual Environment
------------------------------

Creating `virtual environments <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ in 
Python 3.5 is easy as it is a built-in feature. The script is called ``pyvenv-3.5``
and it is in the ``bin`` folder of the installation location. Execute the script
in the folder where you want your virtual environment to be created with the
name of the virtual environment as the parameter, e.g::

	~$ pyvenv-3.5 venv

And the script should do the rest. After the installation, you can enter the
virtual environment by running::

	~$ source path/to/venv/bin/activate

When you activate the script, you should be able to enter Python 3.5 interpreter
by typing ``python`` no matter what base Python you have installed in your 
computer.

To exit the virtual environment, type::

	~$ deactivate


Installing the Requirements
---------------------------

We have included some packages that come in handy in the 
`requirements.txt <https://github.com/assamite/cc-mas16/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_
in the github reposity. Install these packages with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ 
once you have virtual environment active (Python 3.5 comes with pip so there is
no need to manually install it). ::

	~$ source path/to/venv/bin/activate
	(venv) ~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
