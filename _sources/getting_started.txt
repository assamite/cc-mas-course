Getting Started with Python
===========================

In case you have not written a single line of Python before, the internet
offers a great assortment of resources to learn Python. Here are some
links:

	- `Python 3.5 tutorial from the official site <https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/index.html>`_
	- `Python 3.5 API documentation <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/index.html>`_
	- `LearnPython (Python 2) <http://www.learnpython.org/>`_



.. note::
	When reading tutorials from the internet, keep in mind that they might be
	written in Python 2. While most things work the same in both versions,
	there are some differences. One quick check is to look at the code, if it 
	calls ``print`` without parentheses (``print "foo"``), then it is Python 2,
	in Python 3 the parentheses are required (``print("foo")``). Some of the
	key differences are explained, e.g. in `a blog post by Sebastian Raschka
	<http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html>`_.
