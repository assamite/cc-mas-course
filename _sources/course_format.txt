Course Format
=============

The course in given in two parts. First part consists of lectures, discussion
sections and individual assignments. Second part is a group project. Course will
also have a take home exam which students take towards the end of the course.

First Part - Weekly format
--------------------------

First part lasts the first 4-5 weeks of the course. In this part we will have
three sessions per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and two deadline times
per week (Tue 23.55 and Sun 23.55). 

The week schedule is as follows.
On Mondays, we will introduce a new topic in a lecture like session. We
continue to work on the topic on Wednesday, when students have read an article
about the topic (see below). Sessions on Wednesday is more relaxed and
consist of discussion, group work, etc.. Friday's sessions are meant to be
workshop-like sessions where students can work on their weekly exercises
(see below). None of the sessions are compulsory, however, you will get course
points from attending Wednesday's sessions.

Each week we will have two kinds of assignments: A short essay from an article,
and a set of other assignments. Although the articles are also on the course
website, all the assignments are published in this documentation. Assignments
are returned through Moodle (see :doc:`assignments`).

Each week, Students read a short original article and write **a short** essay of
the article summarizing its main points in **pdf** format. The hard limit for the essay length is
250 words, however, 150-200 words should be sufficient. Check your word counts!
Article deadlines are each week on Tuesdays 23.55 (excluding the first week when
the deadline is on Thursday 23.55), and the article for the next week is
revealed latest on the previous week's Wednesday.

Other assignments consist of programming, mathematical and other practical work.
Their deadline is on Sunday 23.55 every week, and they are revealed latest on
Monday of the same week. These exercises should be returned as a compressed
file (zip, tar.gz) that extracts to a folder containing the exercise code
and other documentation. **The folder has to be named with your UH username!**
If there is any possibility for misinterpretation, add a README file explaining
the file(s) associated with each exercise.

Following, is the coarse explanation for the weekly schedule:

	=============	======================================	============================
	Event			Agenda									Format
	=============	======================================	============================
	Mon: Session	Introduce a new topic.					lecture
	Tue 23.55: DL	Article essay due.						**pdf**, return in Moodle

	Sun 23.55: DL	Other exercises due.					**zip, tar.gz**, return in Moodle
	=============	======================================	============================


Second Part - Group Projects
----------------------------

.. note::
	Exact details of the group project will be revealed later. However, you
	can assume that a group is 2-4 persons, and a single person is not a group.

The second part consists of group projects and covers the rest of the course.
In the second part, there is a weekly meeting where the groups present their
work so far and on the last week there is *a demo session* which is compulsory
for all the students. The demo session date is fixed later, but a good
alternative is Friday 16.12. 14-16.

Take Home Exam
--------------

.. note::
	Details to be revealed towards the end of the course.


Grading
-------

The course is graded based on deliverables from both parts and doing a take home
exam towards the end of the course. On the first part, students get course points
from returned exercises, essays and participation at the discussion sessions
(Wednesdays). On the second part, students get course points from the returned
group work. The first and second part are weighted so that the full points will give
30% of the maximum course points from each. The take home exam will give the rest of the 
points (40%). However, as the exam will have also questions about the group project,
the actual weight of the project will be higher.

.. warning::
	You will need at least half of the points from each of the three deliverables
	(Part 1, Part 2 and the exam) to pass the course! 

Deliverable cheat sheet:

	========================================	======
	Deliverable(s)								Weight
	========================================	======
	Part 1 - essays	and attending discussion	15%
	Part 1 - Weekly exercises					15%
