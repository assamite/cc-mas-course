Course Format
=============

The course in given in two parts. First part consists of lectures, discussion
secitons and individual assignments. Second part is a group project. Course will
also have a take home exam which students take towards the end of the course.

First Part - Weekly format
--------------------------

First part lasts the first 4-5 weeks of the course. In this part we will have
three sessions per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and two deadline times
per week (Tue 23.55 and Sun 23.55). Every week, we will introduce a new topic.
On Mondays, we will introduce a new topic in a lecture like sessions. We
continue to work on the topic on Wednesdays, when students have read an article
about the topic (see below). Sessions on Wednesdays are more relaxed and
consist of discussion, group work, etc.. Friday's sessions are meant to be
workshop-like sessions where students can work on their weekly exercises.

Each week we will have two kinds of assingments: A short essay from an article,
and a set of other assignments. Although the articles are also on the course
website, all the assignments are published in this documentation. Assignments
are returned through Moodle (see :doc:assignments).

Each week, Students read a short original article and write **a short** essay of
the article summarizing its main points. The hard limit for the essay length is
250 words, however, 150-200 words should be sufficient. Check your word counts!
Article deadlines are each week on Tuesdays 23.55 (excluding the first week when
the deadline is on Thursday 23.55), and the article for the next week is
revealed latest on the previous week's Wednesday.

Other assignments consist of programming, mathematical and other practical work.
Their deadline is on Sunday 23.55 every week, and they are revealed latest on
Monday of the same week.

Second Part - Group Projects
----------------------------

.. note::
	Exact details of the group project will be revealed later. However, you
	can assume that a group is 2-4 persons, and a single person is not a group.

The second part consists of group projects and covers the rest of the course.
In the second part, there is a weekly meeting where the groups present their
work so far and on the last week there is *a demo session* which is compulsory
for all the studens. The demo session date is fixed later, but a good
alternative is Friday 16.12. 14-16.

Take Home Exam
--------------

.. note::
	Details to be revealed towards the end of the course.


Grading
-------

Course is graded by returning deliverables from both parts and doing a take home
exam towards the end of the course. On first part, students get course points
from returning exercises, writing essays and being in the discussion sessions
(Wednesdays). On the second part, students get course points from the returned
group work. Both of these parts are weighted so that full points will give you
20% of the maximum course points. The take home exam will give the rest of the 
points. However, as the exam will have also questions about the group project,
the actual weight of the project will be higher.

.. warning::
	You will need at least half of the points from each of the deliverables to
	pass the course!

Deliverable cheat sheet:

	=============================	======
	Deliverable(s)					Weight
	=============================	======
	Part 1 - essays and exercises	20%
	Part 2 - Group project			20%
	Take home exam					60%
