Week 4 - Surprise, Evaluation, Reflection
====================================================

	#. **RETURN** The creative artifacts are often said to have three features:
	   high value, novelty and they are surprising. In the last weeks' exercises
	   we have built means to compute the value and the novelty, but have not
	   directly measured surprisingness.

	   Give a short explanation of what a surprising artifact from an agent's
	   point of view would be, and a few examples of how the evaluation of
	   surprisingness could be implemented in a simple way. Write your answers
	   briefly (10-15 sentences).

	   Additional notes:
		* Some of the functionality implemented in the course might be already
		  suitable to measure the surprisingness. You are free to use them as
		  examples. Also, keep in mind that value, novelty and surprisingness
		  are not actually orthogonal measurements of the artifact, i.e. the
		  measurements that measure value may also measure surprisingness to
		  some extent.
		* Wikipedia's definition for surprise is as good as any: *surprise (emotion),
		  a brief emotional state experienced as the result of an unexpected significant event.*
		  Here, the event would naturally be an observation of an artifact.

	#. **RETURN** Pick one from your examples of the implementable suprisingness
	   measures, and implement it to your agents. What are the main differences
	   between it and the value and novelty measures? Is there any overlap between
	   them?

	#. **RETURN** (3pts) Consider your current agent implementation (with all the
	   functionalities you have implemented in the exercises during the course).
	   Explain briefly your current agent design and the functionality of the
	   multi-agent system as a whole and answer the following questions:

	   Ritchie (1pt) (see the article by Anna Jordanous for short introduction):
	   	* What is the inspiring set (if we think as an inspiring set the corpus
	   	  from which the Markov chain was learned) for a single agent and the
	   	  multi-agent system as a whole?
		* Is the agent (or society) able to reproduce all instances in the
		  inspiration set? If not, give an example.
		* Is it able to produce instances outside the inspiration set?
		  If so, give an example.
		* Is it able to produce valued instances outside the inspiration set?
		  If so, give an example.

	   Ventura (1pt):
	   	* On which "level" in Ventura's article does your single agent implementation
	   	  land? Why?
	   	* Consider now the multi-agent system as a whole where the output of the
	   	  system is the set of vote winning artifacts (one per iteration). On
	   	  which "level" does the system as a whole land? Why?

	   Wiggins (1pt):
	   	* Explain your single agent implementation with Wiggins model. What are
	   	  :math:`\mathcal{U}`, :math:`\mathcal{T}`, :math:`\mathcal{R}` and
	   	  :math:`\mathcal{E}`?
	   	* Explain your whole multi-agent system implementation with Wiggins
	   	  model. What are :math:`\mathcal{U}`, :math:`\mathcal{T}`,
	   	  :math:`\mathcal{R}` and :math:`\mathcal{E}`?
